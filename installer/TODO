Need to add the elastic IP to the list of SANs... tricky interdependencies...

Should we have a pre-gen stage?  Where we set up the CA?
Another where we upload our resources?

Should we tag our resources on S3 e.g. with SHA1?

We should probably be able to change the CA key etc

We should regenerate the cert when we have a different set of SANs
